# Diceware

This application implements the Diceware method in picking passphrases using some of the software architecture and design concepts covered in CS575. It was implemented using Angular 5 and Boostrap to demonstrate some of the fundamental software architecture concepts and design patterns such as MVC, services, observables, etc...

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.5.4, NodeJS v8.9.2, NPM 1.5.4, and the latest CDN's of Bootstrap.


## Diceware demonstration
Click on this YouTube link [Diceware](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlnDk_wzl18) to view a demonstration of the application. 

## Initial setup and running development server

1. Install NodeJS v8.9.2 which should come with NPM 1.5.4 via [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
2. Install Angualr-CLI `npm install @angular/cli`
3. Clone the project to your local computer using `git clone https://github.com/surferbv/diceware` in your terminal or command prompt.
4. Run `ng serve --open` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

Note: If you are running it for the first time you may need to run `npm install` in the project directory in order for it to work.

## Project file description

### Important referenced files
#### diceware-complete.json: 
This file is located in the `../src/assets/data/` folder and should not be moved in order to the application to function properly. If you do move the locaiton of this file you will need to change the path the the `data.service.ts` refers to in the code.

#### Bootstrap CDN:
Ensure that you have a proper internet connection as the applicaiton refers to the following cdns. 

https://bootswatch.com/4/sandstone/bootstrap.min.css
https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.2.1.slim.min.js
https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/popper.js/1.12.3/umd/popper.min.js
https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.0.0-beta.2/js/bootstrap.min.js

NOTE: These links are located in the `index.html` file.

### Source Files
#### index.html
This view uses Bootstrap CDN to stylize the content on the page.
It is also important to ensure that the favicon.png file remains in the
same directory otherwise it will not display correctly. It also includes
some important CDN scripts for the UI of the application.

#### app.module.ts
This module contains all the imports and providers for the components 
to function properly. The following imports and providers are added, HttpClientModule, DataService, and PeerMessageService

#### data.service.ts
This service fetches the data in the diceware-complete.json file and makes it available to what
the component that subscribes to it. It is important that the location of the json file remain at
"../assets/data/diceware-complete.json" which should be in the src folder. Without the file the dice component
can not generate words to send to the passphrase component. It uses http to access the data and a map operator
to map the object to a json format.

#### peer-message.service.ts

#### app.component.html
This view also uses Bootstrap CDN to stylize the content on the page.
It also references the some images and applies the selectors of
it's child components in this view.

#### dice.component.ts
This component uses two services one to accessing the data via a "DataService" and one to send the
word generated to the passphrase component using a "PeerMessageService". Only this component can
publish message to the "PeerMessageService" since we don't won't the passphrase component to modify
the message but rather read it and combined it with its phrase.

#### dice.component.html

#### passphrase.component.ts
This component subscribes to "PeerMessageService" in order to receive the word generated by the dice component.
It then combines those words and presents them to the user. It does not modify the current message from the
peer service.

#### passphrase.component.html


## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
